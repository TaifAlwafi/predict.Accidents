## Project 1 Proposal 

The purpose of the model is to decrease the accidents by data science and machine learning. In this project I'm going to :
- Predict accident severity  
- What are the areas with higher or lower accident severity 
- How to make the number of accidents more lower in the high accident areas 
- Relationship between Traffic accidents and age group data

#### Data Description:

The Accidents and Vehicles datasets were found from governemnt website [www.data.gov.uk]( www.data.gov.uk).
The accidents file contain 3144481 rows and  52 columns , the Vehicles file contains 3004425 rows and  21 columns and the sample of analysis in this project is Accident Severity.
I will use some columns to predict the severity of the accidents such as : Did Police Officer Attend Scene of Accident, Age of Driver, Age of Vehicle, Day of Week, Sex of Driver, and more.
My goal after completing this project is to make the number of accidents more lower in the high accident areas

#### Tools:
- Model : Linear Regression 
- libraryâ€™s : pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib 
- Cloud service : Google colab
